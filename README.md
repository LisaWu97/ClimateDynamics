1. Abstract:
   The El Nino and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) are known to be associated with precipitation and temperature anomalies in the south-western part of the United States. The El Nino phase of ENSO is often associated with higher-than-average precipitation and the reverse phase La Nina with lower. The positive phase of PDO often coincides with higher precipitation of the area and vice – versa. Studies on climate modeling show that as climate change continues to unfold itself, we may experience increased frequencies of more extreme El Nino and La Nina events, and PDO and ENSO are likely to become more in-phase. Through this study, I would like to create a predictive model for precipitation and temperature for the San Joaquin River Basin based on ENSO and PDO indexes. For having advanced knowledge about future water availability can inform water management decisions and allow for earlier planning and preparation for potential shortages. 



2. Overview:
   This is the repository for the Final Project of ES 292 01 - Climate Dynamics.
All the results are generated through file 'DataPlotting120525.ipynb'
The data used, 'pdo.timeseries.ersstv5.csv', 'soi.long.csv' for PDO and SOI indexes and 'avg_precip_temp.csv' for montly precipitation and temperature can also be found in the repository.

3. Desciprtions of Data:
   a. 'pdo.timeseries.ersstv5.csv':
       This is a dataset directly obtatined from NASA's Physical Sciences Laboratory website.

   b. 'soi.long.csv':
       This is a dataset directly obtatined from NASA's Physical Sciences Laboratory website.

   c. 'avg_precip_temp.csv':
       This data is a product of the California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) data. I obtained monthly weather data from active stations located in the San Joaquin Valley region, and averaged monthly precipitation (in) and mean monthly temperature to produce timeseries of regional averages.
