# ClimateDynamics
1. Overview:
   This is the repository for the Final Project of ES 292 01 - Climate Dynamics.
All the results are generated through file 'DataPlotting120525.ipynb'
The data used, 'pdo.timeseries.ersstv5.csv', 'soi.long.csv' for PDO and SOI indexes and 'avg_precip_temp.csv' for montly precipitation and temperature can also be found in the repository.

2. Desciprtions of Data
   a. 'pdo.timeseries.ersstv5.csv':
       This is a dataset directly obtatined from NASA's Physical Sciences Laboratory website. 
       Reference: NOAA Physical Sciences Laboratory. 2025. “PDO from ERSST V5.” December 11. https://psl.noaa.gov/pdo/.
   b. 'soi.long.csv':
       This is a dataset directly obtatined from NASA's Physical Sciences Laboratory website. 
       Reference: Climatic Research Unit, University of East Anglia. n.d. “Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) Data.” Accessed October 27, 2025. https://psl.noaa.gov/data/timeseries/month/SOI/.
   c. 'avg_precip_temp.csv':
       This data is a product of the California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) data. I obtained monthly weather data from active stations located in the San Joaquin Valley region, and averaged monthly precipitation (in) and mean monthly temperature to produce timeseries of regional averages.
